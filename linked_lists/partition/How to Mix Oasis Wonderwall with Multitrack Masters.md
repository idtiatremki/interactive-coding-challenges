Multitrack masters are the original recordings of each individual instrument or vocal track in a song. They allow you to isolate, edit, and process each element separately, giving you more control and flexibility over the final mix. You can find multitrack masters of Wonderwall online[^2^] [^3^], or you can use a software like Audacity or GarageBand to create your own from a stereo file.
 
Here are some tips on how to mix Oasis' Wonderwall with multitrack masters:
 
- **Balance the levels.** The first step is to adjust the volume of each track so that they blend well together and create a coherent sound. You can use a meter or your ears to find the optimal level for each track. A good rule of thumb is to start with the drums and bass as the foundation, then add the guitars, piano, strings, and vocals on top. You can also use panning to create a stereo image and give each track its own space in the mix.
- **EQ the tracks.** EQ stands for equalization, which is the process of boosting or cutting certain frequencies in a sound. EQ can help you shape the tone of each track, enhance clarity, remove unwanted noise, and avoid frequency clashes. For example, you can use a high-pass filter to cut the low frequencies from the guitars and piano, leaving more room for the bass and drums. You can also use a low-pass filter to cut the high frequencies from the cello and strings, creating a warmer sound. You can also use EQ to boost or cut specific frequencies that define the character of each instrument or vocal.
- **Compress the tracks.** Compression is the process of reducing the dynamic range of a sound, which is the difference between the loudest and quietest parts. Compression can help you control the volume fluctuations of each track, make them sound more consistent and punchy, and glue them together in the mix. For example, you can use compression to smooth out the vocals, tighten up the drums, and add sustain to the guitars. You can also use compression to create parallel effects, such as adding a compressed copy of the drums to create more impact.
- **Add reverb and delay.** Reverb and delay are effects that create a sense of space and depth in a mix. Reverb simulates the sound of a room or environment, while delay repeats a sound after a certain time interval. Reverb and delay can help you create a more realistic and immersive sound, as well as add some ambience and interest to each track. For example, you can use reverb to make the vocals sound more spacious and lush, or use delay to create rhythmic echoes on the guitars. You can also use reverb and delay to create contrast between different sections of the song, such as adding more reverb to the chorus than the verse.
- **Master the mix.** Mastering is the final stage of mixing, where you apply some global processing to the entire mix. Mastering can help you enhance the overall quality, loudness, and balance of your mix, as well as prepare it for different platforms and formats. For example, you can use mastering tools such as EQ, compression, limiting, saturation, and dithering to polish your mix and make it sound more professional and cohesive.

Mixing Oasis' Wonderwall with multitrack masters can be a fun and rewarding experience that will improve your mixing skills and knowledge. You can experiment with different settings and effects to create your own version of this timeless song. Remember to listen carefully and critically to your mix, compare it with other references, and get feedback from others. Happy mixing!
